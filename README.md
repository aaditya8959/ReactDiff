# Numerical Implementation Of Reaction-Diffusion System

Reaction-diffusion(RD) systems form a class of PDEs used to model pattern-formation. In their most basic form, they involve an interplay between
a linear model of diffusion and non-linear model of reaction between multiple species, which results in a heterogeneous solution(pattern)
under seemingly inconspicuous initial conditions. They arose in the then nascent field of mathematical biology with the foundational work
of Alan Turing, and since then, has been applied to a wide range of scenarios.

This repository is intended to be a collection of C++ codes to model different RD systems, written on top of the deal.II FE library.
